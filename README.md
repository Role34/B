# B (Programming Language)

> Will be release in late 2023 or early 2024

## Introduction
B is a custom programming language I made because I don't like c++ very much (B's interpreter is written in c++ though), I mean I really like c++ but some syntax/format is kind of annoying and sometimes it bugs your whole project.  
The base syntax and formatting I would say is quite similar to C# or Python, but differs as task complexity increases.  

***B scripts have the file extension of .b, .black, and .bx.***  
***This programming language will support graphics.***  

<!---
This programming language will cooperate as a programming language and will support some programming language as a support language. If you are willing to wait then you will see how powerful this programming language in 2023/2024!.
The B language will be written in C++, The B# language will be written in B, and B++ language will be written in B and B#. Thank you. :)
